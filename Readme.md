# Creating A Streaming platform and I am not distracted form LoA OKKK

## MY expectations from this project:

- Convert Video into - 3 Qualities
- Send Video Data as per network speed ( FastAPI Backend )
- Seemless Playing video ( React Front End )
- Auth Layer so different Users will have different Files and monthly bandwidth/quality limit ( For no only me and a Guest for testing )
- Loading Speed controller + Auto Loadings option based on network speed
- Different Modes (UDP/TCP) + One automode with autoswitching between protocols

## Tech Stack

- FastAPI ( if it can for backend and files packet serving other wise some new Library in Python )
- ReactJS for simple frontend clean simple with speed and simple control I repeat Sssimple someone remind me please If I start giving some strange ideas
